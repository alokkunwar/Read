Directory File Traversal(DFTW)
Overview
DFTW is a C program that recursively traverses a directory structure and performs various file operations based on command-line arguments. The tool leverages the nftw() system call to explore file trees and provides functionalities like counting files and directories, calculating file sizes, copying directory structures, and moving directories.

Features
Count Files: Lists the total number of files present in a given directory and its subdirectories.
Count Directories: Lists the total number of directories present in a given directory and its subdirectories.
Calculate File Size: Computes the total size of all files in a directory tree (in bytes).
Copy Directory Structure: Copies an entire subdirectory, maintaining its structure at the destination. Optionally, you can exclude files by their extension.
Move Directory: Moves an entire subdirectory to another location, deleting the source after the move.
Command-Line Arguments
Count Files
Counts and lists the total number of files in the directory tree rooted at root_dir.

Command: $ dftw -nf /home/user/documents
Output: Total number of files: 42
Count Directories
Counts and lists the total number of directories in the directory tree rooted at root_dir.

Command: $ dftw -nd /home/user/documents
Output: Total number of directories: 7
Calculate File Size
Lists the total size (in bytes) of all files present in the directory tree rooted at root_dir.

Command: $ dftw -sf /home/user/documents
Output: Size of all files: 204800 bytes.
Copy Directory Structure
Copies the subdirectory from source_dir to destination_dir, maintaining the directory structure. If a file extension (.c, .txt, .pdf) is provided, files of that type will be excluded from the copy.

Command: $ dftw -cpx /home/user/source /home/user/destination .txt
Move Directory
Moves the entire subdirectory from source_dir to destination_dir and deletes the original directory after the move.

Command: $ dftw -mv /home/user/source /home/user/destination
